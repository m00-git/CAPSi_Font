# CAPSi_Font
Custom font (made by me!) to be used within IDEs to emulate the ALL CAPS syntax of Cobol and other old case insensitve languages, while still being able to distinguish between upper and lowercase characters for use with modern case sensitive languages by having capital letters underlined.
